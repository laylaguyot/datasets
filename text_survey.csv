However, we mostly had to learn to data clean ourselves. As such, I read a little bit about mice packages and missforest. However, I feel like it would be a lot clearer with some guided instruction, especially since many of the articles on data cleaning mentioned that it is oftentimes 70-90% of the job in data modeling.","I love making themed playlists! I have a collection of maybe 70 something playlists on Spotify, ranging from a jellyfish theme to an Avatar: The Last Airbender Earth Nation theme.  ","Mostly, I hope we get clear communication and help if we ask direct questions about a concept.
